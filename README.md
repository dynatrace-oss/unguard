# ![Unguard Logo](docs/images/logo/unguard-logo-red-small.png) Unguard

**Unguard** (üá¶üáπ [Àà änÀå…°uÀêat] like disquieting, üá´üá∑ [√£Àà…°ard] like the fencing command) is an **insecure** cloud-native
microservices demo application. It consists of eight app services, a load generator, and two databases. Unguard
encompasses vulnerabilities like server-side request forgery (SSRF), Command/SQL injection, JWT key confusion,
remote code execution and many more.

The application is a web-based Twitter clone where users can register/login, post text, URLs and images and follow users.
Unguard also features fake ads, a possibility to edit your biography and manage your membership.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Unguard is composed of eight microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over REST.

## Quickstart

To quickly get started with Unguard, install the Unguard Helm chart using the [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/)

> **Warning** \
> Unguard is **insecure** by design and a careless installation will leave you exposed to severe security vulnerabilities. Make sure to restrict access and/or run it in a sandboxed environment.

1. Add the bitnami repository for the MariaDB dependency

   ```sh
    helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   ```

2. Install MariaDB

   ```sh
   helm install unguard-mariadb bitnami/mariadb --set primary.persistence.enabled=false --wait --namespace unguard --create-namespace
   ```

3. Install Unguard

   ```sh
   helm install unguard  oci://ghcr.io/dynatrace-oss/unguard/chart/unguard --wait --namespace unguard --create-namespace
   ```

To customize your Unguard chart installation, see the [chart README](chart/README.md)


## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Kubernetes Deployment

See the Unguard Chart [README](chart/README.md) on how to install Unguard in your Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.

## ‚ú® Features

* **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)/[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)**: The app is designed to run on a local
  Kubernetes cluster, as well as on the cloud with AWS.
* [**Jaeger Tracing**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/): Most services are instrumented using trace interceptors.
* [**Skaffold**](https://skaffold.dev/): Unguard is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
* **Synthetic Load Generation**: The application comes with a deployment that creates traffic using
  the [Element](https://element.flood.io/) browser-based load generation library.
* **[Exploits](./exploit-toolkit/exploits/README.md)**: Different automated attack scenarios like JWT key confusion
  attacks or remote code execution.
* **[Monitoring](docs/MONACO.md)**: Dynatrace monitoring by
  utilizing [MONACO](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code).

## ‚ûï Additional Deployment Options

* **Tracing and Jaeger**: [See these instructions](docs/TRACING.md)
* **Malicious Load Generator**: [See these instructions](src/malicious-load-generator/README.md)
