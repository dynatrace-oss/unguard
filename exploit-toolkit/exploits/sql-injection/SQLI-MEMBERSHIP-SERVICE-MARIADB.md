# SQL Injection

Utilizing [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) can lead to sensitive data being read
and/or databases to be modified (Insert/Update/Delete).
In addition, administrative operations such as shutting down the DBMS can also be completed.

Unguard provides the functionality to insert specific membership texts for users on the profile page, and as the membership text
is not checked before being inserted into an SQL statement, it is possible to insert SQL commands which will then be run.

## Preconditions and Requirements

For this exploit to work you need:

* [unguard](../../../docs/DEV-GUIDE.md) deployed and running
* (optional) [unguard-exploit-toolkit](../../INSTALL.md) set up

## Exploitation

To inject an SQL command, you simply need to log into Unguard, go to your profile page and click on the membership banner next to
your user text. In the dropdown on the membership page you can either choose between PRO and FREE membership or insert
SQL statements which need to be properly prepared (see the next chapter "w/o Toolkit CLI").

### With Toolkit CLI

Using the `ug-exploit` tool, SQL statements can be injected.
Make sure to use `ug-exploit login` first, as you need to be logged in to change the membership state.

Afterwards, use `ug-exploit sql-inject-dotnet` and type your desired command.
When using the CLI, you only need to specify the SQL statement to be injected. In this example,
your input would just need to be:

```sql
UPDATE membership
SET membership = 'injected'
WHERE 1 = 1;
```

A status code of 200 means that the statement was successfully executed, and 500 means that there was an error.

#### Examples

Deleting all entries of the table:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE membership;
```
