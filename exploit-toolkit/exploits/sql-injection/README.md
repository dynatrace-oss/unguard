# SQL injection

Unguard has three SQL injection vulnerabilities:
* [One in the Java `profile-service`](./SQLI-PROFILE-SERVICE-H2.md), which is exploitable through the user biography and allows you to access the h2 database.
* [One in the Golang `status-service`](./SQLI-STATUS-SERVICE-MARIADB.md), which is exploitable through the search bar on the Users page and allows you to access the MariaDB database.
* [One in the PHP `like-service`](./SQLI-LIKE-SERVICE-REMOVE-LIKE.md), which allows you to remove another user's like on a given post.
