# SQL Injection

Utilizing [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) can lead to sensitive data being read
and/or databases to be modified (Insert/Update/Delete).

Unguard has a PHP microservice for handling likes that uses an unsafe version of Laravel, allowing you to remove another user's like on a post. When liking/unliking, normally, the PHP service would receive a post ID and a user ID, but with the right parameters, you can send two post IDs, leading to the latter one being misinterpreted as the user ID by Laravel ([see more details](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-LARAVELFRAMEWORK-1060045)).

## Preconditions and Requirements

For this exploit to work you need:

* [unguard](../../../docs/DEV-GUIDE.md) deployed and running
* (optional) [unguard-exploit-toolkit](../../INSTALL.md) set up

## Removing another user's like
You can exploit the vulnerability in the PHP Like Service either with or without the Toolkit CLI.
In any case, you will have to find out the user ID of the user whose like you want to remove.
This ID is exposed indirectly through the Users page. The admanager user always has the ID 1, and you can see that it is listed at the top of the users page.
The user shown below the admanager has the ID 2, the one below that has the ID 3 etc.

### With Toolkit CLI
You can use the `ug-exploit` tool for exploiting the vulnerability. Make sure to use `ug-exploit login` first.

Afterwards, use `ug-exploit sql-inject-unlike-post` and enter the post and user ID. That should delete the specified user's like. The returned status code will always be 404.
