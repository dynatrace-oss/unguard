# Command injection when posting markdown bio

Command injection (sometimes CMD injection) is an attack that involves executing arbitrary commands on some host OS.
Typically, this happens because of insufficient user input validation.

When posting a bio string with markdown enabled, the `profile-service` uses a shell program called markdown to do the
markdown to HTML conversion, but does not properly escape the user input, resulting in the possibility to execute
arbitrary shell commands.

## Preconditions and Requirements

For this exploit to work you need:

* [unguard](../../../docs/DEV-GUIDE.md) deployed and running

## Exploitation

To exploit the command injection vulnerability in the `profile-service`, you have to log in, go to your own profile and
set a bio string with the checkmark "Enable markdown" checked, that contains additional commands.

### w/o Toolkit CLI

Without the CLI, you can simply craft your own payload:

Posting the following will result in executing `tail -n /etc/passwd` and taking the output of that to convert it from
markdown into HTML and write it into your bio.

```text
' & tail -n 1 '/etc/passwd
```

Sending that request will result in a similar command to be executed on the `proxy-service`:

```shell
/bin/sh -c echo '' & tail -n 1 '/etc/passwd' | markdown
```

#### Examples

Writing linux kernel information into your bio:

```text
' & uname '-a
```
