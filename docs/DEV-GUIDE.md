# Development Guide

This document explains how to build and run Unguard locally using `skaffold`. 

> Most of the services rely on the Kubernetes DNS. If you must deploy some parts of the application without a Kubernetes cluster, read the READMEs of the individual services.

## üóíÔ∏è Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)
* [kustomize](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/installation/)
* [OpenJDK11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

## ‚õµ Local Cluster

1. Launch a local Kubernetes cluster with one of the following tools:

    - To launch **Minikube** (cluster in a VM and slow on Windows):
        ```sh
        minikube start --addons=ingress --profile unguard
        # üçé for macOS a vm-based driver is needed (https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/7332)
        minikube start --addons=ingress --profile unguard --vm=true
        ```    

    - To launch a **Kind** cluster:
        ```sh
        kind create cluster --name unguard
        ```
      
2. Run `kubectl get nodes` to verify the connection to the respective control plane

3. Fetch the necessary Helm repositories

    ```sh
    helm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts # optional
    helm repo update
    ```
   
3. Use `skaffold` to build and deploy the application (first time will be slow). If the images should be rebuilt automatically, run `skaffold dev`.

    - The Docker daemon inside the **Minikube** can be re-used to improve the experience with building and running Docker images:
    ```sh
    # üêß for Linux
    eval $(minikube -p unguard docker-env)
    skaffold run --detect-minikube
    # üçé for macOS   
    source <(minikube docker-env -p unguard)
    skaffold run --detect-minikube
    # üíª for Windows (PowerShell)
    & minikube -p unguard docker-env | Invoke-Expression
    skaffold run --detect-minikube
    ```
   
    - With **Kind** the images will be moved automatically to the cluster:
    ```sh
    skaffold run
    ```

4. Access the frontend through your browser

   For local development you can use the skaffold profile < localdev >

    ```sh
    skaffold run -p localdev
    ```    
   This will apply the local Ingress resource and expose the frontend and the ad-service. Make sure to have an Ingress Controller installed on your cluster.  
   If you use kind, also make sure to create the cluster with extraPortMappings.  
   The Ingress Controller will be exposed over the port you define in the extraPortMappings.  
   <br>
   If you don't use minikube, you will have to manually install the nginx ingress controller.  
   The recommended version is:
   ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.44.0/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
    ``` 
   
   <br>
   
    You can also use port forwarding to access the frontend and the ad-service
    ```sh
    # exposes the frontend on localhost:3000
    kubectl port-forward -n unguard service/unguard-frontend 3000:80
    ```

    Currently, the ad-service has to be exposed to the end-user just like the frontend. For usage in the cloud, an ingress needs to be set up (TODO [CASP-10192](https://dev-jira.dynatrace.org/browse/CASP-10192)).
    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward -n unguard service/unguard-ad-service 8082:80
    ```

    To make non-blind SSRF exploits, you can expose the proxy-service as well.
    This would be common practice with applications where the browser makes the requests (like Angular/React/Vue etc.).

    ```sh
    # exposes the proxy-service on localhost:8081
    kubectl port-forward -n unguard service/unguard-proxy-service 8081:80
    ```

## üî• Cleanup

Run `skaffold delete` to clean up the deployed resources.
