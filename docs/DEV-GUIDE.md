# Development Guide

This document explains how to build and run Unguard locally inside Kubernetes using `skaffold`.

> **Warning:** Most of the services rely on the Kubernetes DNS. If you must deploy some parts of the application without a
> Kubernetes cluster, read the READMEs of the individual services instead.

## 🗒️ Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)
  CLI v2, and [Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io), or, alternatively [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) on Windows

## ⛵ Local Cluster

### 🅰 First-Time Cluster Setup

1. Launch a local Kubernetes cluster

    * Launch a `minikube` cluster with the ingress addon

        ```sh
        minikube start --addons=ingress --profile unguard
        ```
    * or, launch a `kind` cluster with [extraPortMappings](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#extra-port-mappings) for
      the local ingress

        ```sh
        kind create cluster --name unguard --config ./k8s-manifests/localdev/kind/cluster-config.yaml
        ```

        * Also, make sure to deploy an nginx ingress controller so that Unguard can be exposed locally (without port-forwarding)
            ```sh
            kubectl apply -k ./k8s-manifests/localdev/kind/
             ```


2. Run `kubectl get nodes` to verify the connection to the respective control plane

### 🅱 Application Deployment

1. Use `skaffold` to build and deploy the application.
   The first full build will take up to 20 minutes.
   If the images should be rebuilt automatically, run `skaffold dev`.

    ```sh
    skaffold run
    ```

2. Add an entry in your `/etc/hosts` file to access the ingress exposing the frontend on **[unguard.kube](http://unguard.kube/)**

    * For **minikube** clusters, execute this in your shell or manually add the output of `minikube -p unguard ip` to
      your `/etc/hosts` file

    ```sh
    sudo -- sh -c "echo $(minikube -p unguard ip) unguard.kube >> /etc/hosts"
    ```
    * For **kind** clusters, append this to `/etc/hosts`:

    ```sh
    127.0.0.1 unguard.kube
    ```


### 🔥 Cleanup

Run `skaffold delete` with the chosen profile used to start unguard to clean up the deployed resources.

```sh
skaffold delete [-p <profile>]
```

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQ

### What are skaffold profiles?

Have a look at the profiles that are supported in `skaffold.yaml`.
If you want to enable tracing use the `tracing` profile. [See these instructions](TRACING.md)

```sh
skaffold run -p tracing
```

### How can I have fast, incremental Java builds during development?

To benefit from incremental Java builds in the container, install [OpenJDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/).

Then deploy the application using [jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib]):

```sh
skaffold run -p jib
```

### How can I switch between multiple clusters?

Clusters are configured in `~/.kube/config`.

To switch between different clusters (e.g., between `aws` and `kind`) set the `current-context:` to a cluster saved in
the `contexts:` section.

A great tool that makes this process faster is [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).

### Is there more?

Maybe you find something in the other [FAQ](FAQ.md) document.

## Troubleshooting

1. Skaffold did not detect the running minikube:

   Skaffold normally detects reliably a running minikube and should adapt automatically, if not forwarding minikubes's docker
   daemon might help:

   For more information see :https://skaffold.dev/docs/environment/local-cluster/#auto-detection

    ```sh
    # on 🐧 Linux
    eval $(minikube -p unguard docker-env)

    # on 🍎 macOS
    source <(minikube docker-env -p unguard)

    # on 💻 Windows with PowerShell
    & minikube -p unguard docker-env | Invoke-Expression
    ```
