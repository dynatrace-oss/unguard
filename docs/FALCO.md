# Falco

> The cloud-native runtime security project, is the de facto Kubernetes threat detection engine.

[Falco](https://falco.org/) was created by Sysdig in 2016 and is the first runtime security project to join CNCF as an incubation-level project. Falco detects unexpected application behavior and alerts on threats at runtime.
